================================================================================
Building with autotools
================================================================================
In the instructions, the $ represents your shell's prompt (you don't type the in
the $ part of the command -- note that if you are using a different shell you
may see a % instead of $. That is fine, the instructions should still work).

	$ sh bootstrap.sh
	$ cd ..
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ ../v2.1/configure
	$ make
	$ make check
	$ make install
	$ make installcheck

================================================================================
Installing to a non-standard location
================================================================================
Note that if you are anticipating keeping up-to-date with the
repository or have multiple NCL builds that you test against, then
you may want to install in a non-standard location.
For instance invoking:
	$ ../v2.1/configure --prefix=`pwd`/installed
will make the install products go inside an installed subdirectory
of your build directory. This is paricularly helpful if you
build several different variants (you can have builddebug and buildrelease
directories built from the same source tree).

================================================================================
Running from a non-standard location
================================================================================
If you do install to a non-standard location, then you may have to add the path
to the installed library (the argument to prefix plus the subdirectory lib/ncl)
to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable. Note that on Mac (and possibly
other BSD OS versions) you have to set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable rather
than LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

If you use bash you can do this by adding something like this to your
~/.bash_profile file:

##############################################################################
if test -z $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
then
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix/lib/ncl"
else
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix/lib/ncl"
fi
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

##############################################################################

where you substitute the path that you passed as a --prefix to configure for the
string "/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix" above.

================================================================================
Building with cmake
================================================================================
NCL includes CMakeLists.txt files for users who have projects that are built
with cmake.

        $ cmake . -B cbuild
        $ cd cbuild
        $ make
        $ make install

To install to a non-standard location, you can change the cmake line to:

        $ cmake . -B cbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix

================================================================================
Building with meson
================================================================================
NCL includes meson.build files for users who have projects that are built with
meson.  After installing meson, enter the following commands from the top ncl
directory:        

        $ meson setup mbuild
        $ cd mbuild
        $ meson compile
        $ meson test
        $ meson install

To install to a non-standard location, you can change the cmake line to:

        $ meson setup mbuild --prefix=/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix

To set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you can add something like this to your
~/.bash_profile file:

##############################################################################
if test -z $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
then
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix/lib"
else
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/abs/path/to/your/install/prefix/lib"
fi
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
##############################################################################

This differs slightly from where autotools and cmake put the libraries because
they are not put in an ncl subdirectory.
        
================================================================================
Building with bjam
================================================================================
NCL includes a Jamroot file for users who have projects that are built
with the bjam tool.
